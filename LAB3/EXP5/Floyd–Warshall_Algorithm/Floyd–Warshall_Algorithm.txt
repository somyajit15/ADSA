All Pair Shortest Path using Floyd–Warshall Algorithm
=========================================================

AIM:
-----
To find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices using
the Floyd–Warshall Algorithm.

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Floyd–Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes
shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
It can handle negative edge weights but not negative cycles.

The algorithm iteratively updates the distance matrix by considering
each vertex as an intermediate node.

INPUT:
------
1. Number of vertices
2. Adjacency matrix of the graph

OUTPUT:
-------
Matrix showing shortest distances between every pair of vertices.

ALGORITHM:
----------
1. Read number of vertices.
2. Read adjacency matrix.
3. Replace zero weights with infinity (except diagonal).
4. For each vertex k:
   a. Update distance[i][j] using vertex k as intermediate.
5. Display the final distance matrix.

APPLICATION:
------------
Used in traffic networks, routing algorithms, and graph analysis
applications requiring all-pairs shortest paths.

RESULT:
-------
The shortest distances between all pairs of vertices are successfully
computed using Floyd–Warshall Algorithm.
