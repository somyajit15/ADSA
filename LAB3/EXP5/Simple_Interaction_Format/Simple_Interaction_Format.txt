Experiment No. 5(a)
Graph Generation using Simple Interaction Format (SIF)
=========================================================

AIM:
-----
To generate and represent a graph using Simple Interaction Format (SIF)
and store it in the form of an adjacency matrix.

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Simple Interaction Format (SIF) is a simple text-based format used to
describe graphs. Each line represents an edge between two vertices
along with the weight of the edge.

FORMAT:
-------
source_vertex  destination_vertex  weight

The program reads the number of vertices and edges from the user,
accepts edges in SIF format, and generates the adjacency matrix of
the graph.

INPUT:
------
1. Number of vertices
2. Number of edges
3. Edge details in SIF format (u v w)

OUTPUT:
-------
Adjacency matrix representing the graph.

ALGORITHM:
----------
1. Read number of vertices.
2. Initialize adjacency matrix with zero values.
3. Read number of edges.
4. For each edge, read source, destination, and weight.
5. Update adjacency matrix accordingly.
6. Display the adjacency matrix.

APPLICATION:
------------
Graph generation using SIF is useful in network analysis,
pathfinding algorithms, and graph-based applications.

RESULT:
-------
The graph is successfully generated and displayed using the
Simple Interaction Format.
