Single Source Shortest Path using Dijkstra Algorithm
=========================================================

AIM:
-----
To find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other
vertices using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest
path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted
graph with non-negative edge weights.

The program uses an adjacency matrix representation of the graph
and calculates the minimum distance from the source to all vertices.

INPUT:
------
1. Number of vertices
2. Adjacency matrix of the graph
3. Source vertex

OUTPUT:
-------
Shortest distance from the source vertex to all other vertices.

ALGORITHM:
----------
1. Read the number of vertices.
2. Read the adjacency matrix.
3. Initialize distance array and visited array.
4. Set distance of source vertex to zero.
5. Select the unvisited vertex with minimum distance.
6. Update distances of adjacent vertices.
7. Repeat until all vertices are visited.
8. Display shortest distances.

LIMITATIONS:
------------
Dijkstra’s algorithm does not work with graphs having negative
edge weights.

APPLICATION:
------------
Used in GPS navigation systems, routing protocols, and network
optimization problems.

RESULT:
-------
The shortest paths from the source vertex are successfully computed
using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
