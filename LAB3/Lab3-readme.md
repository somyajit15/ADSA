Binary Search (Recursion & Non-recursion): this Program implements binary search using both recursive and iterative approaches to locate an element efficiently in a sorted array.

Heapsort: this Program implements heap sort using max-heap construction to sort an array in ascending order.

Mergesort: this Program applies the divide-and-conquer mergesort algorithm to recursively split and merge sub-arrays into sorted form.

Quicksort: this Program performs quicksort using partitioning to recursively sort elements around a pivot.

Binary Search Tree (BST): this Program implements creation, insertion, searching and traversal operations in a Binary Search Tree.

Stack Operations: this Program implements stack structure using array/pointers and supports push, pop, display and other operations.

AVL Tree: this Program implements AVL self-balancing Binary Search Tree with rotations to maintain height balance during insertions.

B-Tree: this Program implements multi-way B-Tree supporting insert and traversal operations for balanced disk-based indexing.
