Ellipsoid Method: Program implements the Ellipsoid optimization technique used to solve linear programming problems by iteratively shrinking ellipsoids around the feasible region.

Interior Point Method: Program solves linear programming problems using the interior point approach, moving through the interior of the feasible region toward the optimal solution.
