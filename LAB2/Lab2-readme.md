LUP Decomposition: Program performs matrix factorization into Lower, Upper, and Permutation matrices (L, U, P) for stable numerical computation.

LUP Solver: Program uses the LUP decomposition result to efficiently solve systems of linear equations using forward and backward substitution.

Strassen’s Multiplication: Program multiplies two matrices using Strassen’s divide-and-conquer algorithm to reduce computational complexity compared to normal matrix multiplication.
