Kruskal’s Algorithm: Program finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph using Kruskal’s algorithm based on sorting edges and applying Union–Find.

Prim’s Algorithm: Program finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph using Prim’s algorithm by growing the MST from a starting node.

Huffman Coding: Program implements Huffman data compression by constructing a binary tree based on character frequencies to generate optimal prefix codes.

LCS (Longest Common Subsequence): Program computes the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming.

KMP String Matching: Program performs efficient pattern matching using the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm and the LPS (prefix) table to avoid rechecking characters.

Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication: Program multiplies two matrices using Strassen’s divide-and-conquer algorithm to reduce multiplication complexity.
